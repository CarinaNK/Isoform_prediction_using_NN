In this project we attempt to reduce the dimmensionality of gene expression data and use it to predict isoform expression data. This is done through the use of variational autoencoders and feed forward neural networks. In the process of this work we deal with a variety of challenges related to data management and appropriate hardware for the project before being able to conclude that while not working perfectly the tendency for a functional predictive model is there.
